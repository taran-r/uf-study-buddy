# UF Study Buddy

## Overview
The UF Study Buddy was created to help University of Florida students quickly find important course information by using actual UF syllabi as data. Instead of having to dig through PDF syllabi to find dates, policies, grading breakdowns, or even study resources, simply select your major and class from the dropdown menus, then type your question to recieve an AI-powered answer. 

The tool was created to make it easier for students to access relevant syllabus details. Whether you want study tips, content explanations, policy clarifications, or grading details, the AI will answer using information pulled directly from the real course syllabi.

Although this program was designed for UF students, others can use it with their own syllabi and API keys.
